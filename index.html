  <H1 class="subtitleheader">Time Travel back to 2006</H1>


    <h1 class="bodytext"> I was in NJ and she was out of state. It was a long distance relationship that grew into mutual respectful times. I even got along very well with her mom then. To make a long story short unforeseen circumstances happened and we lost contact. Unfortunately, in this situation, time still moved on without each other. 😢 Hopefully today, she is happy and life is great for her and her family. Now it's 2026 and I still wonder how she's doing?  </h1>

        <h1 class="bodytext"> Did you ever meet someone that touched your life in a extremely positive way? That situation happened for me then and her name is Tiffany.  After all these years, it would be awesome to know how's she's doing today? That's it, maybe someone will see this that knows her and will pass it along to Tiffany or to her family or friends. My name is Billy <span class="pro3"> (below)</span> and it's nice to meet you. My email link to communicate with me is in the footer below. Think of this website as only a friendly message in a bottle floating down the river of life. 😀 Thank you and God Bless!</h1>

      <H1 class="subtitleheader">A little more about me...</H1>



        <h1 class="bodytext">  I worked many years as a graphic designer with A&P Supermarkets in their corporate offices in Northern NJ and loved it. Unfortunately, A&P went out of business in late 2015 and I bounced around as a designer after that for the next five years, living in Maryland and Pennsylvania and back to New Jersey doing print ads for supermarket advertising. While the Covid Pandemic was going on and even to date, I learned as much as I could using online courses from Udemy.com about website design.  I love it and do it as a steady side hustle when I get the chance. I work retail mostly today to pay the bills. </h1>

                <h1 class="bodytext">Above is an email from Tiffany's mom whose name is Lisa, from 2006. We were in communication then about how Tiffany was doing. Some areas are blacked out now to respect the privacy of the situation. Well, respectfully, it would be great to see how she is doing today! I have been trying in normal ways to find her in the past for many years with fail, and today, since I learned web design to a degree, will give this form of communication a go. A message in a bottle! Over all this time like in a lot of relationships, contact was lost or broken in normal ways but the respect is still there. She lived so far away. My goal is to see if she is ok, that's it. Hope all is well Tiffany!</h1>

          <h1 class="bodytext"> I get it.  I know this might seem odd and I respect everyones privacy today.  I really mean well here with this website as I am looking for Tiffany today. She was a very bright light in time for me in those few months of mutual communication, knowing her and today, all I was hoping for is that she is ok and doing great!  Maybe she is happily married today with children? That would be cool as I want her to be happy. Maybe she is single? Us, however, had so much positive potential in those days as I think about it now. I did know her mom Lisa well too. I wasn't really a stranger, but we never met (I regret that now) due to long distance, money reasons for travel and other circumstances. I was just a very good friend as who knows what the future would have brought if we did met up? If luck was on our side. Maybe she thinks about me from time to time today too and she doesn't know how to get a hold of me? So think of this like a message in a bottle, floating down the river of life and maybe it will land in a happy place to find her or her family and friends to tell her this message inside the bottle...and that is Billy is OK, and I hope you are too. I would love to say hello to you today. It's kind of like that popular Dan Fogelberg song called Same Old Lang Syne...😉 <span class="pro3">(bottle picture from internet)</span></h1>
